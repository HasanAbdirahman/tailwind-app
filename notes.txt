npx i tailwindcss- creates a config tailwind file that place u can write your own class
npm init -y 
at package json : replace the test place or below with 
  -  "tailwind": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./build/css/style.css --watch",
   - npm i -D prettier-plugin-tailwindcss -devdependecy
"prettier" : "npx prettier --write **/*.html **/*.jsx  " - this line is added bcoz tailwind wants css to be 
written in certain order in order to evaluated buut writing this we do not have worry about that 

for **/*.html the 2 astretics that are extra indicates that they only check html components only

- then run { npm run tailwind }thus building cc/style.css folder and file 

if you come to the file or change the package json name then you have "npm run tailwind" - DON'T FORGET


lastly run npm run prettier at bash terminal and gives u error if u have and rearrange css styles
EVERYTIME YOU START A TAILWIND WORK RUN {npm run tailwind}
